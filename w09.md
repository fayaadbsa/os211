# Top 10 List of Week 9

1. [What is Booting?](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/02-boot.html)<br>
An operating sytem is sometimes described as “the first program,” one that allows you to run other programs. However, it is usually stored as a file (or, more commonly, a collection of files) on a disk. How does this “first” program get to run?
The operating system is loaded through a bootstrapping process, more succinctly known as booting. A boot loader is a program whose task is to load a bigger program, such as the operating system

2. [Which is better, MBR or GPT ?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mbr-vs-gpt-whats-the-difference-between-an-mbr-partition-and-a-gpt-partition-solved/)<br>
You have to partition a disk drive before you can use it. MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) are two different ways of storing the partitioning information on a drive. This information includes where partitions begin and end on the physical disk, so your operating system knows which sectors belong to each partition and which partition is bootable. This is why you have to choose MBR or GPT before creating partitions on a drive.

3. [Swap Space Management](https://educatech.in/swap-space-management/)<br>
The amount of swap space needed on a system can vary depending on the amount of physical memory, the amount of virtual memory it is backing, and the way in which the virtual memory is used. It can range from a few megabytes of disk space to gigabytes.

4. [What's RAID ?](https://www.steadfast.net/blog/almost-everything-you-need-know-about-raid)<br>
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. That means that RAID is a way of logically putting multiple disks together into a single array. The idea then is that these disks working together will have the speed and/or reliability of a more expensive disk. Now, the exact speed and reliability you'll achieve from RAID depends on the type of RAID you're using. 

5. [UEFI vs BIOS ?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uefi-vs-bios/)<br>
This post gave you an overview of the differences between BIOS and UEFI. It also advises you when to choose either one of them and how they are different from each other.

6. [NVMe vs SSD vs HDD](https://unihost.com/help/nvme-vs-ssd-vs-hdd-overview-and-comparison)<br>
This article will be laying out the differences, explaining which is better/worse, and providing details on how the technology for each storage type works.

7. [Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7)<br>
Curabitur ut orci quis quam cursus hendrerit vel pulvinar metus
Phasellus blandit nunc consequat eros aliquam porta.
Pellentesque sapien diam, facilisis tincidunt accumsan quis, accumsan suscipit velit. 
Morbi id est maximus, maximus urna eu, auctor odio. 
Nunc sit amet dictum ipsum.

8. [(non) Volatile Memory ?](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/collegesuccess2x48x115/chapter/volatile-and-non-volatile-computer-memory-session-6/)<br>
Volatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. Most modern semiconductor volatile memory is either Static RAM (see SRAM) or dynamic RAM (see DRAM). SRAM retains its contents as long as the power is connected and is easy to interface to but uses six transistors per bit. Dynamic RAM is more complicated to interface to and control and needs regular refresh cycles to prevent its contents being lost.

9. [Disk Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. Disk scheduling is important because multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.

10. [Learning Systemd](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/systemd)<br>
systemd is controversial for several reasons: It’s a replacement for something that a lot of Linux users don’t think needs to be replaced, and the antics of the systemd developers have not won hearts and minds. But rather the opposite, as evidenced in this famous LKML thread where Linus Torvalds banned systemd dev Kay Sievers from the Linux kernel.
